# std::io Design — Writer Trait, Extern Fn & Removing Builtins

> **Status:** design phase. Not yet implemented. Binding before code is written.
> **Decisions baked in:** `core`/`std` two-tier stdlib layering (§11),
> `Display`/`Debug` traits for formatting (§11), `string::format` as the one formatting
> mechanism (§11), `std::io` includes `print`, `println`, `read_line`, `dbg` (§11).
> **Prerequisites:**
> - [`modules-design.md`](modules-design.md) — Phase 1–3 (module graph, cross-module name
>   resolution, multi-file pipeline). Needed to host `core::io` and `std::io` as modules.
> - [`modules-design.md`](modules-design.md) — Phase 4 (prelude). Needed for `print`/`println`
>   auto-import.
> **Companion docs:** [`DESIGN_SPEC.md`](../DESIGN_SPEC.md) §11 (stdlib),
> [`modules-design.md`](modules-design.md) (the prerequisite — modules),
> [`traits-design.md`](traits-design.md) (Writer is a trait),

## 0. The concern this answers

Today, `print` and `println` are VM builtins — hardcoded strings intercepted in the VM's
call dispatch. This is the correct v0 approach, but it's a dead end:

- **No composability.** Can't write to a file, a buffer, or a socket with the same API.
  Every I/O target needs its own builtin.
- **No testability.** Can't capture output in tests without intercepting stdout at the OS
  level.
- **No principled I/O.** The design spec (§11) says `std` includes `io` backed by
  `Writer`/`Reader` traits — but there's no mechanism for library code to call into the
  host runtime.
- **No trait-based dispatch.** Without `extern fn`, the only way to reach the host is
  through VM builtins, which are invisible to the type system and can't participate in
  trait dispatch.

The goal: build `extern fn` (the bridge to the host) and `std::io` (the Writer pattern),
then remove the print builtins entirely.

---

## 1. Extern fn — the bridge to the host

Extern functions let library code declare a function signature without providing a body.
The VM provides the implementation at runtime. This is how Axiom code reaches the host
(Rust) for I/O, system calls, and anything else that touches the outside world.

### 1.1 Syntax

```axiom
// Declare a host function — no body
extern fn write(fd: I32, buf: &[U8]) -> I32;
extern fn read(fd: I32, buf: &mut [U8]) -> I32;
```

- `extern fn` has a signature but no body. Terminated with `;`.
- It's `pub` or private like any other function.
- It can be a method (`extern fn write(let self, ...)`) or a free function.
- It lives in a module — `core::os::write`, `std::io::_write_stdout`, etc.

### 1.2 IR representation

New instruction:

```rust
// In ir.rs
IrInstr::ExternCall {
    dst: Reg,               // return value
    name: String,           // host function name, e.g. "io._write_stdout"
    args: Vec<Reg>,         // arguments
}
```

- `name` is a flat string — the VM uses it to look up a Rust callback.
- No type info needed in the IR — the type checker already validated the call.

### 1.3 VM host callback mechanism

The VM gets a new field:

```rust
pub struct Vm {
    // ... existing fields ...
    extern_fns: HashMap<String, ExternFn>,
}

type ExternFn = Box<dyn Fn(&[Value]) -> Result<Value, VmError>>;
```

- Extern functions are registered at VM initialization.
- The VM's `run()` loop handles `ExternCall` by looking up the name in `extern_fns`,
  calling the Rust function, and storing the result.
- If the name isn't registered → runtime error (should be caught at compile time, but
  this is the safety net).

### 1.4 Registration

When the VM is created, the host registers available extern functions:

```rust
let mut vm = Vm::new(program);
vm.register_extern("io._write_stdout", Box::new(|args| {
    let buf = args[0].as_bytes();
    let s = std::str::from_utf8(buf).map_err(|_| VmError::InvalidUtf8)?;
    print!("{}", s);
    Ok(Value::I32(buf.len() as i32))
}));
```

### 1.5 What this does NOT include

| Feature | Status | Why |
|---|---|---|
| C FFI (`extern "C"`) | `[Deferred → v2]` | Calling C libraries — separate concern from host callbacks |
| Callbacks from Rust into Axiom | `[Deferred → v2]` | Reverse direction — needs function pointers or closures |
| Variadic extern fns | `[Deferred → when needed]` | `extern fn printf(fmt: &str, ...)` — not needed for v1 |

---

## 2. Writer trait & std::io

With modules (prerequisite) and extern fn in place, the I/O stack becomes possible.

### 2.1 The Writer trait — `core::io`

```axiom
// core/io.ax
pub trait Writer {
    fn write(let self, let data: &[U8]) -> Result<usize, IoError>;
    fn flush(let self) -> Result<(), IoError>;

    // Default method — convenience
    fn write_all(let self, let data: &[U8]) -> Result<(), IoError> {
        let written = 0
        while written < data.len() {
            let n = try self.write(data[written..])
            written = written + n
        }
        Ok(())
    }

    fn write_str(let self, let s: &str) -> Result<(), IoError> {
        self.write_all(s.as_bytes())
    }
}
```

### 2.2 The Reader trait — `core::io`

```axiom
// core/io.ax
pub trait Reader {
    fn read(let self, let buf: &mut [U8]) -> Result<usize, IoError>;
}
```

### 2.3 IoError — `core::io`

```axiom
// core/io.ax
pub enum IoError {
    WriteFailed,
    ReadFailed,
    // expand as needed
}
```

### 2.4 Stdout implementation — `std::io`

```axiom
// std/io.ax
use core::io::{Writer, IoError}

// Extern fn — the actual bridge to the host
extern fn _write_stdout(buf: &[U8]) -> I32;

pub struct Stdout { }

impl Writer for Stdout {
    fn write(let self, let data: &[U8]) -> Result<usize, IoError> {
        let n = _write_stdout(data)
        if n < 0 {
            Err(IoError::WriteFailed)
        } else {
            Ok(n as usize)
        }
    }

    fn flush(let self) -> Result<(), IoError> {
        Ok(())  // stdout is line-buffered by the host
    }
}
```

### 2.5 Convenience functions — `std::io`

```axiom
// std/io.ax

pub fn print(let s: &str) {
    Stdout {}.write_str(s)    // panics on error — acceptable for convenience
}

pub fn println(let s: &str) {
    print(s)
    print("\n")
}
```

### 2.6 Prelude integration

`print` and `println` are added to the prelude (see `modules-design.md` Phase 4) so
they're available without `use`:

```axiom
// prelude.ax (compiler-internal)
use std::io::{print, println}
use core::option::{Option, Some, None}
use core::result::{Result, Ok, Err}
```

`println("hello")` works in any file without imports. The user can still write
`use std::io::println` explicitly for clarity.

### 2.7 What this does NOT include

| Feature | Status | Why |
|---|---|---|
| `string::format` | `[Deferred → alongside Display]` | Needs `Display` trait + format machinery — separate effort |
| `Display` / `Debug` traits | `[Deferred → with traits impl]` | Requires traits to be fully working first |
| `dyn Writer` (trait objects) | `[Deferred → v1.1]` | Requires vtable generation — static dispatch is enough for now |
| `BufWriter`, `BufReader` | `[Deferred → v2]` | Wrapping types — needs trait objects or generics to be ergonomic |
| File I/O (`std::fs`) | `[Deferred → v2]` | Separate extern fn set (`open`, `read`, `write`, `close`) |
| `read_line` | `[Deferred → with stdin]` | Needs `Reader` trait + `Stdin` implementation |
| `dbg` | `[Deferred → with Debug]` | Needs `Debug` trait for value formatting |
| `Stderr` | `[Deferred → with Stdout]` | Same pattern, trivial once Stdout works |

## 3. Implementation phases

### Phase 1 — Extern fn syntax & IR

**Goal:** `extern fn` parses, type-checks, and lowers to IR.

- [ ] Parse `extern fn name(params) -> RetType;` (no body) → `Item::ExternFn` in HIR
- [ ] Type check: validate parameter and return types
- [ ] IR: new `IrInstr::ExternCall { dst, name, args }`
- [ ] IR lowering: calls to `extern fn` emit `ExternCall` instead of `Call`
- [ ] Error: extern fn with a body
- [ ] Error: non-extern fn without a body
- [ ] Golden file tests for extern fn IR output

**Test:** Define `extern fn add(a: I32, b: I32) -> I32;`. Lower to IR. IR contains
`ExternCall` instruction.

### Phase 2 — VM extern fn support

**Goal:** The VM can invoke host-provided function implementations.

- [ ] VM: add `extern_fns: HashMap<String, ExternFn>` field
- [ ] VM: add `register_extern` API
- [ ] VM: handle `ExternCall` instruction — look up and invoke host callback
- [ ] VM: store return value in destination register
- [ ] Error: calling an extern fn with no registered callback → clear runtime error
- [ ] VM trace output: `ExternCall` appears in traces

**Test:** Define `extern fn add(a: I32, b: I32) -> I32;` in Axiom. Register a Rust
callback that adds. Call from Axiom code. Result is correct.

### Phase 3 — core::io

**Goal:** `Writer` and `Reader` traits exist in the compiler's `core/` directory.

- [ ] Create `core/io.ax` with `IoError` enum
- [ ] Create `core/io.ax` with `Writer` trait (write, flush, write_all, write_str)
- [ ] Create `core/io.ax` with `Reader` trait (read)
- [ ] Verify: these files compile (parse + type check) as part of the module system

**Test:** `core/io.ax` parses and type-checks without errors.

### Phase 4 — std::io

**Goal:** `Stdout`, `print`, `println` work through the Writer trait.

- [ ] Create `std/io.ax` with `extern fn _write_stdout`
- [ ] Create `std/io.ax` with `Stdout` struct
- [ ] Implement `Writer for Stdout` — delegates to `_write_stdout`
- [ ] Define `print`, `println` as regular functions in `std/io.ax`
- [ ] Register `_write_stdout` as a VM extern callback (Rust `print!` underneath)
- [ ] End-to-end test: `println("hello")` prints to stdout

**Test:** `println("hello")` works. Writing to a custom `VecWriter` in tests works.

### Phase 5 — Prelude & builtin removal

**Goal:** `print`/`println` come from `std::io`, not VM builtins.

- [ ] Update prelude to import `print`, `println` from `std::io`
- [ ] Remove `print`/`println` from VM builtins list
- [ ] Remove `is_builtin("print")` / `is_builtin("println")` checks from VM
- [ ] Update IR golden files — `println` calls go through `std::io::println` →
  `_write_stdout` → `ExternCall`
- [ ] Update VM trace golden files
- [ ] All existing tests still pass (same behavior, different path)

**Test:** `println("hello")` works without any `use` statement. No builtins remain.

Phase 3 (core::io) ──────────► Phase 4 (std::io)┘
```

- Phases 1–2 (extern fn) are independent of modules — could be built in parallel.
- Phases 3–4 (core/std io) require both modules and extern fn.
- Phase 5 (prelude + cleanup) requires modules Phase 4 (prelude) and std::io Phase 4.

## 5. Compiler architecture changes

### 5.1 Changes to existing crates

| Crate | Change |
|---|---|
| `axiom-parser` | Parse `extern fn` declarations (no body, `;` terminator) |
| `axiom-hir` | Add `Item::ExternFn { name, params, ret_ty }` node |
| `axiom-typeck` | Type check extern fn signatures; validate calls match signatures |
| `axiom-ir` | `IrInstr::ExternCall`; lower extern fn calls to `ExternCall` |
| `axiom-vm` | `extern_fns` map, `ExternCall` handler, `register_extern` API |
| `axiom-driver` | Register std extern callbacks when creating VM |

### 5.2 VM changes (minimal)

The VM gets two additions:
1. `extern_fns: HashMap<String, ExternFn>` — host callbacks
2. `ExternCall` instruction handler — look up + invoke

Everything else (module resolution, visibility, name resolution) happens before the IR
reaches the VM. The VM sees flat IR with qualified names, same as today.

---

## 6. Testing strategy

### 6.1 Extern fn tests

- Define `extern fn`, register Rust callback, call from Axiom → correct result
- Multiple extern fns with different signatures
- Error: extern fn not registered → runtime error with clear message
- Extern fn as method on a struct

### 6.2 std::io tests

- `println("hello")` prints to stdout (integration test)
- Custom `Writer` implementation: `VecWriter` captures output → testable
- `Writer::write_all` default method works
- `Writer::write_str` delegates correctly
- Prelude: `println` available without `use`

### 6.3 Golden file updates

- IR golden files: `println` no longer a `Call` to a builtin, but a normal call chain
  through `std::io::println` → `_write_stdout` → `ExternCall`
- VM trace golden files: updated call chain

---

## 7. Risks and mitigations

| Risk | Impact | Mitigation |
|---|---|---|
| Extern fn name collisions | Two modules register same name | Namespaced names: `io._write_stdout`, not `_write_stdout` |
| Missing extern callback at runtime | Panic or UB | Clear error message: "extern function 'io._write_stdout' not registered" |
| Writer trait needs generics too early | Scope creep | `Writer` works without generics — each impl is for a concrete type. Generics come later. |
| Prelude importing `print` before `std::io` exists | Ordering dependency | Phase 5 is explicitly last — prelude update happens after std::io is working |
| `core` ↔ `std` circular deps | Compiler stdlib broken | Strict layering: `core` never imports from `std`. `Writer` lives in `core`, `Stdout` in `std`. |
