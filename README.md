> **Working names (revisited at 1.0):** language **Axiom** · file extension **`.ax`** · build tool / package manager **`forge`**.

Axiom is a statically typed, compiled, general-purpose language aiming for
**deterministic memory safety with no garbage collector and no lifetime
annotations**. It reads like Swift/Kotlin, types like Rust (ADTs + exhaustive
`match`), handles errors like Zig (error sets + `try`/`catch`/`errdefer`), and
does concurrency like Go (colorless green threads) — held together by one
compiler-enforced rule the others abandon: **one obvious way to do each thing.**

The heart of the language is its memory model: **Mutable Value Semantics**
(borrowing as a *calling convention* — `let`/`inout`/`sink` — not a reference
type) plus **Perceus** compile-time reference counting. This is the Hylo/Koka
resolution, *not* "Rust without the borrow checker": keep determinism, drop the
checker, replace references-as-types with conventions + refcounting.

The compiler is written in **Rust**. Native backend: **Cranelift**; a second
register-IR interpreter backend targets WASM (dual-backend).

## A taste of Axiom

> ⚠️ Illustrative — the syntax below follows [`DESIGN_SPEC.md`](DESIGN_SPEC.md).
> The front-end, type checker, IR lowerer, and register-IR interpreter (VM) are
> built; structs, enums, `match`, control flow, generics + monomorphization,
> traits (including default methods), generic enums, and an `.ax` standard
> library (`List<T>`, `Map<K,V>`, `Option<T>`) run end-to-end on the VM. What's
> missing is Cranelift codegen, the memory model (ownership + Perceus), and the
> rest of the language surface (error handling, concurrency).

**Structs, traits, and methods** — receivers declare a borrowing convention
(`let`/`inout`/`sink`), the same machinery as parameters; no `&self`/`&mut self`:

```rust
struct Point { x: Float, y: Float }

impl Point {
    fn origin() -> Point { Point { x: 0.0, y: 0.0 } }    // associated fn
    fn dist(let self, other: Point) -> Float { ... }     // borrows self (read)
    fn translate(inout self, dx: Float, dy: Float) {     // mutates self
        self.x += dx
        self.y += dy
    }
}
```

**Sum types + exhaustive `match`** (the *only* branching tool over ADTs; missing
a variant is a compile error):

```rust
enum Shape {
    Circle(Float),
    Rect(Float, Float),
}

fn area(let s: Shape) -> Float {
    match s {
        Circle(r)  => 3.14159 * r * r,
        Rect(w, h) => w * h,
    }
}
```

**Borrowing as a calling convention** — visible at the call site, no lifetimes:

```rust
fn rename(inout u: User, n: String) { u.name = n }
fn archive(sink u: User) { db.store(u) }   // consumes u

var u = User { ... }
rename(inout u, "Sam")   // mutation stated at the call site
archive(sink u)          // consumption stated at the call site
// u is now invalid — referencing it is a compile-time error
```

**Errors are values** — error sets + `try`/`catch`/`errdefer`, no exceptions
(`FsError!Config` is sugar for `Result<Config, FsError>`):

```rust
error FsError { NotFound, AccessDenied }

fn read_config(path: String) -> FsError!Config {
    val file = try open(path)        // propagate on Err
    errdefer log_failure(path)       // runs only on the error-return path
    val text = try file.read_all()
    return parse(text)               // success auto-wrapped in Ok
}

val cfg = read_config("/etc/app") catch |e| match e {
    FsError.NotFound     => default_config(),
    FsError.AccessDenied => panic("permission denied"),
}
```

**One unified `loop`, `if`/`match`/blocks are expressions**:

```rust
loop x in items { print(x) }          // iterator form
loop if ready() { tick() }            // pre-condition form (replaces while)

val grade = if score >= 90 { "A" } else if score >= 80 { "B" } else { "C" }
```

**Structured (colorless) concurrency** — green threads in a lexical `scope`
nursery; no `async`/`await`, no function coloring:

```rust
fn fetch_all(let urls: List<String>) -> List<Response>!NetError {
    scope |s| {
        val handles = urls.map(|u| s.spawn(|| http_get(u)))
        handles.map(|h| try h.join())
    }   // scope can't exit until every spawned task finishes or is cancelled
}
```

## Status

**Phase: front-end complete; generics, traits, and a small stdlib run on the
register-IR interpreter.** The design is settled and the pipeline stages are
built test-first, lossless, and total (never panic, never drop source). The VM
executes programs end-to-end — structs, enums, `match`, control flow, function
calls, generics + monomorphization, trait-method dispatch (including default
methods), generic enums, and a library `List<T>`/`Map<K,V>`/`Option<T>` written
in `.ax`. `axiom run file.ax` compiles and interprets a program today. The
memory model — the language's load-bearing bet — has passed its de-risking spike.

| Stage | Component | Status |
|---|---|---|
| Design | [`DESIGN_SPEC.md`](DESIGN_SPEC.md) — full language design, every decision tagged `[Decided]`/`[Deferred]` | ✅ Settled (living doc) |
| Memory-model spike | [`docs/spike-0-findings.md`](docs/spike-0-findings.md) — Path A de-risk | ✅ **Preliminary GREEN** (23/23 scenarios matched intent; named follow-ups remain) |
| Lex | [`crates/lexer`](crates/lexer) — source → lossless, tiling token stream | ✅ Done (snapshot + invariant + fuzz tested) |
| Parse | [`crates/parser`](crates/parser) — tokens → lossless CST (rust-analyzer-shaped green/red tree) | ✅ Done; total recovery, recovery-set-aware |
| Structural HIR lowering | [`crates/lower`](crates/lower) — CST → ID-keyed HIR (names unresolved) | ✅ Done (M1); golden + diagnostic snapshot tested |
| Name resolution | [`crates/resolver`](crates/resolver) — resolve names, `@lang` items, desugar pass | ✅ Done (M1); scope-chain resolution + diagnostics |
| Type checking (THIR) | [`crates/typecheck`](crates/typecheck) — HIR → THIR via bidirectional type checker | ✅ Done (M2); golden + diagnostic + invariant tested |
| Generics + traits | [`crates/typecheck`](crates/typecheck) — unification, inference, trait checking, default-method dispatch | ✅ Done; wired through IR → VM |
| Monomorphization | [`crates/specialize`](crates/specialize) — discover generic instantiations, produce `MonoInstance` records | ✅ Done |
| Pipeline orchestration | [`crates/driver`](crates/driver) — single multi-module pipeline (parse→lower→resolve→validate→typecheck) | ✅ Done |
| IR generation | [`crates/ir`](crates/ir) — THIR → register IR (basic blocks, SSA-lite registers) | ✅ Done (M3); golden traces + invariants |
| Register-IR interpreter | [`crates/vm`](crates/vm) — executes IR: structs, enums, match, control flow, calls, generics, traits, collections | ✅ Done; snapshot + e2e + invariant tested |
| Standard library | `crates/stdlib/source/` embedded via [`crates/stdlib`](crates/stdlib); multi-file loading in [`crates/modules`](crates/modules) — core traits, `Option<T>`, `List<T>`, `Map<K,V>`, `print`/`format`, all in `.ax` | ✅ Running on the VM |
| Cranelift codegen | — | ⬜ Not started |
| Ownership pass + Perceus | — | ⬜ Not started (the v1 identity) |
| `forge`, LSP | — | ⬜ Not started |

**Path A is chosen** (systems-capable: no GC, zero-cost, exclusivity discipline);
Path B (simpler, with a GC escape hatch) remains the documented fallback if the
exclusivity rule proves too costly in practice.

### What's next

Per [`DESIGN_SPEC.md` §14](DESIGN_SPEC.md), the **v0** milestone is an
end-to-end pipeline `lex → parse → resolve → typecheck → IR → Cranelift` with
*naive* memory (no exclusivity) — to prove the pipeline runs end to end. The
front-end, IR, and register-IR interpreter are complete, and generics, traits
(including default methods), generic enums, and a small `.ax` standard library
(`List`/`Map`/`Option`) now run end-to-end on the VM. The next frontier is a
minimal **Cranelift backend** to produce native executables. The real memory
model (ownership pass + Perceus) and full error handling land in **v1**, where
the language identity arrives.

Each crate carries its own `README.md` with a per-file responsibility table —
start there when diving into a stage.

### Test harness

Snapshot, invariant, fuzz, and golden tests across all 12 crates. Each pipeline stage has its own testing spec
(`docs/*-testing.md`) with a 6-layer test stack:

1. **Unit tests** — Rust-side logic in `#[cfg(test)]` modules
2. **Golden snapshots** — `.ax` → `.hir`/`.cst`/`.thir`/`.stderr` files, checked in, regenerated with `UPDATE_SNAPSHOTS=1`
3. **Diagnostic snapshots** — error `.ax` files paired with `.stderr` expected-output
4. **Drift guards** — coverage invariants that fail the build if any AST/HIR node or diagnostic variant is untested
5. **Round-trip / tiling invariants** — lossless reconstruction assertions (lex, parse)
6. **Fuzz targets** — arbitrary input, assert invariants hold

## Build & test

Requires a stable Rust toolchain (edition 2021).

```bash
cargo build                                      # build the workspace
cargo test                                       # all tests (incl. fuzz suites)
cargo fmt --all                                  # format (max_width 100)
cargo clippy --all-targets -- -D warnings        # lint — warnings are errors
```

**Pre-commit gate** (all must pass):

```bash
cargo fmt --all && cargo clippy --all-targets -- -D warnings && cargo test
```

Try it:

```bash
cargo run -p cli -- check path/to/file.ax     # lex → parse → lower → resolve → typecheck
cargo run -p cli -- run   path/to/file.ax     # …then IR → VM, and execute it
cargo run -p cli -- run   showcase/showcase.ax  # the feature-tour demo program
cargo run -p lexer --example lex -- path/to/file.ax  # dump tokens (lexer only)
cargo run -p parser --example parse -- path/to/file.ax  # dump CST (parser only)
cargo run -p typecheck --example typeck -- path/to/file.ax  # dump THIR (type checker)
```

## Design principles (the load-bearing rules)

- **Singular idiom, compiler-enforced.** One loop keyword, one branching tool
  (`match`), one mandatory formatter. Overlapping syntax is rejected by design.
- **Deterministic safety without a GC or lifetimes** — Mutable Value Semantics +
  Perceus, not a borrow checker.
- **No** `async`/`await` (colorless concurrency), **no** algebraic effects, **no**
  inheritance, **no** exceptions, **no** lifetimes in the language surface.
- **Front-end is lossless and total.** Lexer, parser, and HIR lowerer reconstruct
  their input byte-for-byte and never fail — malformed input yields error
  tokens/nodes plus a diagnostics list, never a panic. This is what makes fuzzing
  assert real invariants on *every* input.
- **Simple, non-expert-readable Rust.** Enums + exhaustive `match` over clever
  abstractions; `Result` + `?` for errors; `unsafe` quarantined to the (future)
  codegen/FFI crate only. Mechanically enforced — see
  [`ENFORCEMENT.md`](ENFORCEMENT.md).

## Contributing

Read [`CLAUDE.md`](CLAUDE.md) for orientation, [`RUST_CONVENTIONS.md`](RUST_CONVENTIONS.md)
before writing Rust, and [`DESIGN_SPEC.md`](DESIGN_SPEC.md) before making any
language-design choice (and update it in the same change if a decision moves).

- Conventional commits: `feat:`, `fix:`, `refactor:`, `test:`, `docs:`.
- Keep per-folder `README.md`s current in the same change that adds/moves a file.
- The enforcement hook needs `cargo` on `PATH` to bite (see `ENFORCEMENT.md`).
